TFTP
====

Simple impelementation in C of TFTP protocol. The project include a client and a multithread server.

Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a simple protocol to transfer files. 
It has been implemented on top of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) using port number 69. 
TFTP is designed to be small and easy to implement, and therefore it lacks most of the features of a regular FTP. 
TFTP only reads and writes files (or mail) from/to a remote server. It cannot list directories, and currently has 
no provisions for user authentication.
